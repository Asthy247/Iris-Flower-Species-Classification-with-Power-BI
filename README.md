# Data Understanding

The Iris dataset comprises 150 samples, each with four features:

**Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters

**Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters

**Petal Length:** Length of the petal in centimeters

**Petal Width**: Width of the petal in centimeters

**Each sample belongs to one of three species of Iris flower:**

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

**Key Findings from the Dashboard:**


**Species Distribution:** The dataset is evenly distributed across the three species.

**Sepal Length and Width:** Iris-setosa has the smallest sepal length and width, while Iris-virginica has the largest.

**Petal Length and Width:** Iris-setosa has the smallest petal length and width, while Iris-virginica has the largest.

**Distinct Features:** The combination of sepal and petal measurements can effectively differentiate between the three species.
